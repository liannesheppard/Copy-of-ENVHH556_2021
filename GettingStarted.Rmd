# Introduction

## Why R Markdown and reproducible reports?

All good data analysis should be reproducible.  Markdown is a popular variant 
of the syntax often used in Wikis, such as Wikipedia.  R Markdown is an 
extension of Markdown to support the execution and rendering of R code within 
the document.  It integrates easily with R to allow you to produce reproducible 
reports.  We will use these tools and reproducible research practices to support 
your development in this course.  

## What is Markdown, and why bother?

Just like an R script is better than typing code in the console, using R 
Markdown is better than using an R script.  R Markdown documents allow you to 
save your code, the output that corresponds to your code, and a record of how 
each calculation and figure was created.  Not only will this help you with the 
homework for this class, it's good practice for doing reproducible research. 

Although a `.Rmd` document looks a lot different from an R script, the basics of 
R Markdown are straightforward compared to the rest of R.  After you become 
familiar with the tricks of R Markdown, you may find it easier and faster to 
use than an R script.

## How to use Markdown
The output (e.g. `.html` or `.pdf`) and source (`.Rmd`) documents are optimally 
used side-by-side so that you can see both the code and its result.  Before you 
knit this yourself, you will need to install the packages `rmarkdown` and 
`knitr`.  (These are already installed on UW-supported RStudio servers.)


# Getting started with R and RStudio

## Log onto RStudio Server

In ENVH 556 we will ensure that all applications and labs work on either of 2 UW 
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) servers running on virtual Linux machines:

  * Plasmid, for DEOHS and EPI students: [plasmid.deohs.washington.edu](https://plasmid.deohs.washington.edu/).
  * SPH server, for all students: [rstudio.sph.washington.edu](https://rstudio.sph.washington.edu/)

For Plasmid you will need to install and sign into [Husky OnNet VPN](https://itconnect.uw.edu/connect/uw-networks/about-husky-onnet/) using your
UW NetID. Plasmid is connected to you departmental network storage.

In addition to centralized application installation and management, RStudio servers provide users a higher level of performance and security compared to local installations. 

Another (non-UW) RStudio server option is [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).

## Install applications locally on your computer

You are welcome to do your work locally on your laptop, but we will not be able 
to provide support for local installations.  You will need the most recent 
version of RStudio and R.  An easy way to do this is to follow directions on a 
tutorial program (Swirl) which begins by walking you through the process of 
downloading R and RStudio.  Here is the link to the Swirl tutorial: 
[https://swirlstats.com/students.html](https://swirlstats.com/students.html). The 
first few Swirl lessons cover the "Basics of R Programming" which may help new 
R users become familiar with R and RStudio.

To work locally, make sure you have installed the `rmarkdown` package.  For this 
document, you will also need to install `knitr`.  If, at any point during this 
process, R tells you that you need to install other packages, do so.

## Become familiar with R and RStudio

The rest of this document focuses on using R Markdown in the course. We assume 
you are already familiar with R and RStudio. If not, there are many resources 
available to learn R and RStudio. Here are a few suggestions:

  * The [R for Data Science (R4DS)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley 
  Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.
  * An R ["Onramp"](https://github.com/deohs/r_onramp/blob/master/README.md) 
  made for beginners by the DEOHS [Coders Group](https://github.com/deohs/coders). 
    + Within the [Resources and getting help](https://github.com/deohs/r_onramp/blob/master/r_resources_and_getting_help.md) 
    section, there are many courses, tutorials, and books we suggest.

# Getting Started with R Markdown

To open a new R Markdown document (`.Rmd`), select 'File', 'New File', 
'R Markdown'.  You will see a window asking you for some information about your 
document; R will use this information to fill in some code in the `.Rmd` file, 
which you can change at any time.  For now, leave the default HTML setting and 
fill in whatever you want for the title and author.  Save this file, just like 
you would save an R script.

The following text is included in new R Markdown documents you create:

> This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for 
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown 
see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

> When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes 
> both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the 
> document. 

Every time you open a new `.Rmd` file, you will see this example.  To turn this
code into a nice document, press the 'knit' button at the top of the panel.  A
window will pop up with the knitted document.  Every time you knit a document,
in addition to showing you the preview in R, it will save the knitted document
in the same location as the `.Rmd` file.

You can run code line-by-line from the `.Rmd` document as you build it.
However, this runs in a different environment than the one used by `knitr`. So
you may have different errors in each.  It can be helpful to knit often.

Here are a few tips and tricks that can help you work quickly in R Markdown, 
which you can't use in a regular R script.

  * Run the current chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows) or Command+Option+c (Mac) 
or press the green 'play button' in the upper-right hand corner of the chunk
  * Run the next chunk: Ctrl+Alt+n (Windows) or Command+Option+n (Mac)
  * Run all chunks above: Ctrl+Alt+p (Windows) or press the upside-down triangle 
in the upper-right hand corner of the chunk
  * Run all chunks: Ctrl+Alt+r (Windows) or go through the 'Run' button drop-down 
(see below)

There are lots more running options if you select the drop-down of the 'Run'
button on the right side of the toolbar for RStudio's text editor panel.  You
can use the arrows to the left of the 'Run' button to help navigate your
document, especially if you have a lot of text.

RStudio's text editor also has a primitive spell-checker which is good at
checking only regular text and not any code or special symbols.  To use it,
press the button to the right of the save button in the toolbar for the text
editor panel.  It has 'ABC' and a green check mark.  If you want something more
sophisticated which will also check grammar, I would recommend knitting to a
Word document and just using the Word spell-checker. Just don't paste code from
Word back into your text editor, as MS Word may modify characters such as
quotes, which will likely break your code.

Here are several good R Markdown resources from [RStudio](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to help you get started: 

  * The [Website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
  * The [Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
  * The [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
  * The [Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

The post [Getting Started with R Markdown â€” Guide and Cheatsheet](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/07/getting-started-with-r-markdown-guide-and-cheatsheet/) 
on R-bloggers is also very helpful.


# Anatomy of a `.Rmd` file

## YAML header

The header is enclosed by dashes and is always at the top of the `.Rmd` file. By
default, it will include a title, author, date, and what type of file the `.Rmd`
will knit to.  You can change the text of the title, author, and date here any
time.  These will show up at the  top of your knitted document.  You can also
change the file type at any time.  For example, replacing `html_document`
with `word_document`, will render a Word file.  However, be aware that some
commands are specific to certain document types, or just show up differently. 
Generally `html_document` seems to be the most flexible and least fussy type of
output.

Whenever you open a new `.Rmd` file and see the example, leave the header and 
delete the rest of the example below the last `---`.  

## Text

To put plain text into an R Markdown document, you don't need anything special.
Text that is black in the `.Rmd` document is plain text in the knitted document.

Blue text in the `.Rmd` indicates that it has been formatted in some way by
using special characters (for example, the knitted text may be bold).  

There are some things that you might be used to in other text processors (like 
Word) which aren't easy to do in R Markdown.  For example, you'll note that I 
don't indent my paragraphs; that's because it's too much work to do in R 
Markdown.  When formatting assignments for this class, you should not spend 
much time making your text 'pretty', but your answers should be well-organized. 
This section will cover some (easy) things to do in R Markdown to organize and 
manipulate text.

To make a new paragraph in your knitted document, hit 'enter' twice.  If you
only hit 'enter' once, it can be difficult to distinguish paragraphs because
there is no change in line spacing and no paragraph indent.  

You can make font **bold**, or *italicized*.

You can make numbered lists (see the 
Table of Contents), or bulleted lists:

* Note the space between the asterisk and the text.

* This is one of the few cases where R cares about a space.

You can organize your content using headings, which are indicated by `# ` (see
my section headings).  The more pound symbols, the smaller the heading.  We show
these examples without knitting them:

```
# Title (level 1)
## Subtitle (level 2)  
### Sub-subtitle (level 3)  
#### Sub-sub-subtitle (level 4)
```

The easy page breaks in R Markdown use `\newpage`.  You can also separate
content using a string of asterisks or at least three dashes (`---`).  The
string of asterisks creates a dividing line in the output as you see below.

****************

The three dashes give the same result:

---

Finally, you can put comments in your `.Rmd` file that won't be visible in your
output.  For example, this text doesn't appear in the rendered document: (it
appears twice in the `.Rmd` file; the second one is not enclosed in back quotes
so it is hidden.)

`<!-- This is a text comment and won't appear in the output -->`

<!-- This is a text comment and won't appear in the output -->

### Using LaTeX

If you want to make your text clearer by using nicely formatted equations, you 
can use the math language LaTeX to write Greek letters and equations.  Below 
are some examples that you can copy and paste, or just Google it.  Be prepared 
to have a little patience, because LaTeX is pretty picky.  This is *not* an 
expectation for ENVH 556, it's just something extra for those of you who are 
interested.  This is also an excuse to plug a 
[useful website for finding LaTeX commands](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html).

$\alpha$

$\alpha_0$

$\alpha_1$

$\beta$

$\pi$

$x_{Exposure}$

$e^{\beta}$

So we can write out models:

$\log(x_{Disease})=\alpha_0+\beta x_{Exposure}$ 

or 

log($x_{Disease}$) = $\alpha_0$ + $\beta$ $x_{Exposure}$


## Chunks

Interspersed in the text are lines of code; these may have a shaded  background
in your `.Rmd` file; these are called 'chunks'.  Chunks start with ` ```{r} `
and end with ` ``` `, each at the beginning of the line.  The position of each
chunk determines where its output ends up in the knitted document.  You can 
think of each chunk as a miniature R script.  If we removed all the text from a 
`.Rmd`, the chunks would make up the complete R script for that analysis.  (The 
code appendix does this for you automatically; see below.)

Within a Markdown document, your code all needs to be in order (you can't print 
a plot after your first paragraph if you don't load the data set until paragraph 
three). You also can't use *anything* outside the Markdown document; you need to 
load packages, load data, etc. all within this Markdown document. This will 
become an issue when you try to knit the document, even if it worked while 
running code straight from the `.Rmd`.

There are lots of extra things you can do with chunks while running code
straight from the `.Rmd`.  In the upper-right corner of RStudio's text editor
panel, there is a button labeled 'Run'; the drop-down menu from that has useful
chunk commands.

Below is the basic format of a chunk.  You can make new chunks by pressing
'Ctrl' 'Alt' 'i' in Windows, or 'Cmd' 'Option' 'i' in Macs.  You can also just
type out the symbols below (note that those are tick marks, not apostrophes!).
If you read this and are still confused, you might check out [this help
guide](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/Rmarkdown.html) as well.

It is good practice to name every chunk with a word following `r`, e.g. 
`{r chunk_name_goes_here, and chunk options go after the comma, options separated by commas}`.  


```{r example_chunk}
#-----example chunk-----------

# Code goes here; output appears below

# By setting the seed, we follow the reproducible research practice that my
# random numbers are the same each time.
set.seed(45)

# Generate random numbers from a Normal distribution and save as a vector.
a <- rnorm(mean=0, sd=2, n=20)
mean(a)

```

The code and output above would not be acceptable in a homework write-up.  You
can use chunk options to change how code and output appear in the knitted
document (but chunk options don't affect anything when you are running code chunk by chunk inside
the `.Rmd` document). Below, I'll give some examples of chunk options; check out
the knitted document to see what each of them do. Chunk options can be combined
by separating them with commas.

### Chunk options

We can control what the code and output of each  chunk look like by changing 'chunk
options'.

*eval=FALSE*  

The following code won't be run.

```{r code_chunk_that_will_not_run, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
#-----code chunk that will not run----

# This code won't even be run!
mean(a)
mean(I can type whatever I want because this is not run.)

```

*echo=FALSE*  

The following code won't be shown, but it will run and the output will be 
displayed.

```{r example_chunk_that_will_not_be_shown, echo=FALSE}
#-----example chunk that will not be shown-----

# This code won't be shown, but it will be run and output will show up.
mean(a)

```

*results="hide"*  

The following output won't be shown, but the code will still run in R.

```{r example_chunk_that_will_not_show_output, results="hide"}
#-----example chunk that will not show output------

# This output won't be shown, but it will still run in R.
mean(a)

```

*Hiding Absolutely Everything: include=FALSE*

To hide absolutely everything, you could use these chunk options:

`echo=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'`

Or, equivalently, just use this one:

`include=FALSE`

For more information about `include=FALSE`, see: 
https://yihui.name/en/2017/11/knitr-include-false/

It is possible to hide errors and warnings in your knitted document.  **Do not**
leave the `message=FALSE` and `warning=FALSE` options turned on while you are
creating your document because they will hide important messages from R.  Just
add these when you are done coding; for example, using `library()` or `p_load()`
often creates some messages which you may wish to hide in your final document.
In general, we *want* to see the messages and warnings from R as we are coding.

The following chunk won't be shown and it creates output that won't be shown.  However, the code will still run in R.

```{r example_chunk_hides_everything, include=FALSE}
#-----example chunk hides everything----------

# This would be how to do all your coding for which you don't want to show the
# output in your lab report. All this code runs, but nothing shows up in your
# knitted document. Any variable I create here will be 'remembered' for the rest
# of this knitted document.
mean(a)

```

*Accept errors:  error=TRUE*

Without this chunk option, if there is an error in your code the document won't
knit at all.  This chunk option is a temporary band-aid to help you record and
understand the error; **do not** make all your chunks `error=TRUE` as a way of
bypassing code issues.

```{r example_chunk_accept_errors, error=TRUE}
#-----example chunk accept errors-----

# Sometimes in a work-in-progress, you may want a knitted copy of everything -
# even things that go wrong. This wouldn't be a chunk option to use in a
# polished homework assignment. This is an error because I haven't loaded the
# titanic data in this document yet (regardless of whether it's loaded in my
# RStudio right now)
head(titanic) 
mean(a)

```

### Naming chunks

It is good practice to name your chunks as we have done in the examples above.
Further, if you put a comment ending with at least 4 dashes at the end of the
first comment line, this shows up in the outline section of your document in
RStudio AND makes it easier to read your code in the appendix.  A comment
formatted this way looks like this: `#-----example chunk name-----`

## Plots

To print a plot, you don't need any special chunk options.  

```{r example_plot}
#-----example plot-----

hist(a)

```

However, to hide a plot you need to use `include=FALSE`, which hides all code 
and output (using `results="hide"` won't work on plots).

*include=FALSE to hide a plot and its code*

The following chunk is hidden, as is its output.

```{r example_plot_is_hidden,include=FALSE}
#-----example plot is hidden----------

# Still run in R, though!
hist(a)

```

## Tables

R Markdown has the ability to create nice tables (nice enough to use for
homework).  There are several different packages for creating tables; these
include `kable`, `stargazer`, and `xtable`. `kable` is the simplest to use and
we show examples in Lab 1. If you wish to develop more sophisticated tables,
explore these other packages.

```{r example_table_with_data_generation}
#-----example table with data generation----

# Generate some toy data as vectors
sex <- rbinom(1, n = 20, prob = .5)
height <- rnorm(mean = (50 + 10 * sex), sd = 10, n = 20)
hair_color <- rep(c("brown", "black", "blond"), length = 20)

# combine within a "tibble" dataframe, oriented by columns
toy.data <- tibble(sex, height, hair_color)

# Create a table with the average and standard deviation of height for each 
# hair color category using `dplyr` functions and the pipe operator, `%>%`, which 
# feeds the output of one function into the input of the next function. 
# The `` notation acommodates non-standard variable names.
table_df <- toy.data %>% 
  group_by(hair_color) %>% 
  summarise(`Average height` = mean(height), 
            `SD of height` = sd(height), 
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  rename(`Hair color` = hair_color)

#example kable table with caption
kable(table_df, caption="Height by hair color")

```


# R Markdown strategies to enhance reproducibility

Reproducible reports with embedded data analyses have many benefits, including:

  * Eliminates typos and transcription errors by pulling results directly from R

  * Automatically updates your results if you change other code (e.g., if I decided
to remove one observation from my data set, I wouldn't have to re-type all my
numbers)

  * Creates a record of exactly how you calculated every number (so another 
scientist could easily reproduce your entire analysis, and you will never 
forget how you calculated something)

In the remainder of this section, we suggest strategies that support
reproducibility.

## Use RStudio projects

An important principle is to keep your scripts, data files, and all other inputs
and outputs within a [project](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) 
folder.  Using an RStudio "project" makes directory organization easy, decreasing 
reliance on `setwd()` commands in your scripts.  You would not refer to files 
outside of this project folder, but instead would use subfolders (e.g., "data", 
"images", etc.) to organize your work within your project.  

Using project folders also works nicely with version control (Git) as the 
project folder becomes your version control "repository" for that project.

Let's make a new RStudio project named "new_project". In the GUI click:

File --> New Project...

In the dialogue box that appears click:

New Directory --> New Project

We can make "new_project" a subdirectory of: "~/Home" and click "Create Project"

From here if your create a new `.Rmd` file it will automatically be placed 
within the project's working directory. We will also set up a new project in the 
first lab.

The following best practices, used within RStudio projects, promote the 
reproducibility of your work even more.

### Use relative file paths, not full file paths

Best practice is to not include full paths ("C://Project_1/data/raw") to your
files, but uses relative paths ("data/raw") instead, so they will be more
portable -- able to run on someone else's system.  Even better, use
`file.path()` to construct these paths to make them platform independent, so a
person can use, e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux to reproduce your results.
Windows users take note: paths like "C:\\data\\raw" or even "data\\raw" will not
work on a Mac. Use "data/raw", or better yet, `file.path("data", "raw")` to
solve this problem.

```{r file_paths}
#-----file paths---------

# Only works on Windows, as other modern operating systems (macOS, Linux) do 
# not support "drive letters", such as "P:"
full_path <- 'P:\\ENVH556'
full_path <- 'P:/ENVH556'

# Will not work on Windows, exposes your username, and won't work for other 
# users
full_path <- '/Users/joanna/ENVH556'

# If you are curious about what the "~" expands to, you can use path.expand()
full_path_to_home <- path.expand('~')
full_path_to_data <- path.expand('~/ENVH556')

# Will work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, etc., if the file is in the user's
# "home directory"
relative_path <- '~/ENVH556'

```

### Use the working directory

The "working directory" is a directory  associated with your default position or 
location within a file system.  For example, if you tell R to look for a file, it 
assumes you mean within the working directory.  It is convenient to make your 
working directory the highest level directory associated with the files and data 
for an analysis.  Meaning, for example, your `.Rmd` file and the directory 
containing your data are within your working directory.  With RStudio projects, 
this all becomes easier, because the project automatically "sets" the working 
directory.  You can check the working directory at any time with the `getwd()` 
function. 

You can even assign the working directory to a variable, to use with relative 
paths. For example, if you wanted to load an `.rds` data file within a 
hypothetical "Datasets" folder contained within your working directory you could 
do something like this with the helpful `file.path()` function:
```{r relative_path_example, eval=FALSE}
#-----relative path example-----

# assign working directory variable
work_dir <- getwd()

# build relative path to data file
relative_data_path <- file.path(work_dir, "Datasets", "data.rds")

# load data, assign to "df" variable
df <- readRDS(relative_data_path)

```

### Notes on working outside of RStudio projects
When working outside of an RStudio project, you'll have to specify your working 
directory. Just like the automatic organization that comes with using a project, 
you can make your default working directory the location of your `.Rmd` file.  If 
you want to change that default, you can use `setwd()`.  For example, let's 
say my RDS file isn't in the same folder as my `.Rmd`:

```{r setwd_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#-----setwd example---------

# Here we use a full file path, but it would be better to use a relative one
setwd("P:/ENVH556")

# Here we use a relative file path, where ".." means "one folder up"
setwd("../ENVH556")

# Here we use a relative file path with file.path(), the recommended method
# because this method supports muliple computing platforms (Windows, Mac, etc.)
setwd(file.path("..", "ENVH556"))

# Now we are ready to read the file
DEMS <- readRDS("DEMSCombinedPersonal.rds")

# You can see that my working directory changed with getwd()
getwd()

```

Using working directories would be especially helpful if you needed to load 
lots of different data files and you didn't want to type out all the file 
paths.  If you always put your `.Rmd` and data files in the same location, you 
should be able to use the default working directory without typing file paths.

One mild word of warning: there are some issues with working directories in R 
Markdown.  If you are having trouble, you may want to make sure that `setwd()` 
is in the same chunk as your `readRDS()` command.  There is also a more 
[elegant solution](http://pbahr.github.io/tips/2016/04/16/fix_rmarkdown_working_directory_issue) 
to this.

## Automate preparation of the working environment

When you write code in R Markdown it needs to be completely self-contained -
that is, it can't rely on anything you loaded, imported, or run outside of the R
Markdown document, e.g., in your RStudio session. An excellent principle is to
automate the preparation of the working environment in your R Markdown document.
This includes setting options and installing software packages.

### Set `knitr`options

The following chunk is an example of setting `knitr` options. (Note:  We already
set `knitr` options at the beginning of this document.)  

```{r set_knitr_options, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#-----set knitr options-----------

suppressMessages(library(knitr))
opts_chunk$set(tidy=FALSE, cache=FALSE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE)

```

You can adjust these to suit your needs at the time of rendering, such as 
disabling echo to make a report for someone who might be distracted by seeing 
R code. Or enable cache once your script is complete and working to allow you 
to more quickly render the script, such as when knitting a slide presentation 
just before you delivering a talk.

For more guidance on `knitr` options, see [knitr
options](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/) or the [knitr
Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/vignettes/knitr-refcard.pdf).

### Install and load packages

A key principle is to only load the packages you will need for your project.  To 
facilitate this, use the `pacman` package in R instead of `install.packages()` 
and `library()`.  This will allow your script to automatically install any 
packages it needs to without forcing the installation of a package which has 
already been installed. Here is an example:

```{r setup_pacman, echo=TRUE, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#-----setup pacman-----------

# Not evaluated here since done at the beginning of the file
# Load pacman into memory, installing as needed
my_repo <- 'http://cran.r-project.org'
if (!require("pacman")) {install.packages("pacman", repos = my_repo)}

# Load the other packages, installing as needed
pacman::p_load(knitr, tidyverse)

```

The first part installs `pacman` if it is missing, then the second part installs
and loads the other packages as needed. If you do this at the top of your script
for any packages needed later in your script, it makes it really easy for people
to see what packages your script depends on. This approach will make it much
more likely someone, particularly a new R user, will be able to run your script
and reproduce your results. Many new R users get completely stuck if they run
code that bombs simply because a package has not been installed. And just
putting in `install.packages()` calls "just in case" will needlessly slow down
your script (each and every time it is run) if the packages have already been
installed.

## Use inline code

One way to ensure reproducibility is to use in-line code.  This incorporates R
results directly within text.  To include code output in a sentence, we use the
format of one backtick followed by "r", a space, and then some R code, and
ending with a second backtick. For example, we can write: "The mean of the data
is `r mean(a)`."  We've seen above that output from chunks is usually not 
'pretty' enough for refined reports, so ideally you pay attention to scientific 
reporting standards, for instance by rounding it to an appropriate number of 
significant figures: The mean is `r round(mean(a), 2)`. This is much better than directly
typing into your text "The mean is 0.217" because it follows several reproducibility principles:

  * Eliminates typos
  * Automatically updates if you change other code (i.e. if I decided to remove 
one person from my data set, I wouldn't have to re-type all my numbers)
  * Creates a record of exactly how you calculated every number (so another 
scientist could easily reproduce your entire analysis, and you will never 
forget how you calculated something)

In general, only use the in-line code format for printing out one or two
numbers.  If you need a table or plot, that needs to come from a chunk.

## Report session information, code, and functions in the Appendix

When you turn in assignments, in addition to your well-written answers (which
should not have any code or raw output), you will need to include the session 
information, embedded code, and functions defined in the .Rmd in a code appendix. 

Both the the `LabReportGuidelines.Rmd` template for ENVH 556 and the appendix 
at the end of this document provide you with example code to 
accomplish this.

### Session Information

At a minimum, your `.Rmd` should record version numbers of R and your packages 
with `sessionInfo()` at the end of your script.


```
sessionInfo()

```

### Code embedded in the R Markdown file

For ENVH 556, we also want to see all of your code consolidated at the end of
your R Markdown output.  The following code for a chunk header will compile all 
your code into an appendix code listing.  (This next version is for display in 
the rendered document and not for execution.  A working version that is included 
in the appendix of this document.  Note that the chunk header containing these 
options should be a single line of code with no line-wrap.)

```
ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE
```

### Functions defined in the R Markdown file

You should also include a list of functions you created for your analysis (i.e. 
functions used in your analysis that were not part of loaded packages).
```
# Show the names of all functions defined in the .Rmd
# (e.g. loaded in the environment)
lsf.str()

# Show the definitions of all functions loaded into the current environment  
lapply(c(lsf.str()), getAnywhere)

```

Note that there is very little code embedded in these guidelines and no 
functions, so the second two chunks produce little or no output.  Generally 
your files will have much longer code appendices.

## Document your code

We encourage you to adopt these best practices when commenting your code to 
improve readability:

  * Comment to keep a running commentary on what your code does.
  * The level of detail should be enough to clarify but not to enough to annoy.
  * Insert comments immediately before the line(s) of code to which they apply.
  * Add spaces and blank lines as needed to separate code and comments.
  * Avoid "side-commenting", putting comments at the end of a line of code.
  * Comments should state what the code does, in the form of an
    [imperative](https://www.wordnik.com/words/imperative).

Here is an example of these put into practice:

```{r comment_example, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
#-----comment example-----------

# Create a vector of temperatures in degrees Celcius
temps <- c(21, 22, 20, 19, 19, 19, 22, 19)

# Calculate the mean temperature and standard deviation
mean(temps)
sd(temps)

```

## Follow a consistent style

Choose a code style and be consistent within your `.Rmd`. Following established 
styles will make your code more readable and easier to follow - for both you 
and others. Here are two popular examples: 

  * The [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) 
  * Google's [R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) 

# Tips on knitting to a PDF

While R Markdown files most easily render to`.html`, You may want to knit your 
R Markdown directly to a `.pdf`.  This is very easy; although sometimes you may 
need to install an extra package.  To check whether your computer is already set 
up to knit to `.pdf`, try selecting the drop-down from the 'Knit' button and 
choosing 'Knit to PDF' (or change your header, as described below).  If that 
doesn't work, you'll have to install the `tinytex` package. You can do this 
within R if you use the [tinytex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) package, which is 
a minimal TeX package for R users.

```
install.packages('tinytex', repos = 'http://cran.r-project.org')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You would only need to run these commands once. You would not normally include 
them in a regular R script, as doing so would needlessly repeat the 
installation, unless you take special precautions, such as wrapping the code 
in an `if` block as as shown below.

```{r install_tinytex, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#-----install tinytex-----

if (!file.exists(Sys.which('texi2dvi'))) {
    # This can take a long time to run
    install.packages('tinytex', repos = 'http://cran.r-project.org')
    tinytex::install_tinytex(force=TRUE)
    if (tinytex:::is_tinytex() != TRUE) warning('tinytex failed to install!')
}

```

If you need a more complete TeX package for other uses, you will need to 
download and install more software, separately from R. For Windows users, 
there is an awesome tutorial 
[here](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-windows-10-952b0c48bfa9), 
and there is also a [Mac version](https://medium.com/@sorenlind/create-pdf-reports-using-r-r-markdown-latex-and-knitr-on-macos-high-sierra-e7b5705c9fd).  
This will walk you through what you need to install (it also goes through 
installing R and RStudio, but you can just skip that).  Once everything is 
installed, you can set your output to `pdf_document` instead of `html_document` 
to switch between `.html` and `.pdf` files.
